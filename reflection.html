    <p>This internship gave me firsthand exposure to how data and data pipelines/systems are managed and work in a large enterprise environment. The project assigned to me allowed me to further experience data ingestion, development of visualisation dashboards, and DevOps—while impacting real users, making my work feel worthwhile and beneficial. 
        I applied knowledge from my classroom learning—such as data structures, pipelines, and dashboard design—to contribute to my assigned project. 
        I could proficiently navigate and use Excel to hash out PII information for data ingestion. 
        I could also create a simple mock dashboard from my learning in Year 1 DAVA module.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>Throughout the internship, I developed technical skills in SQL, Excel, Power BI, MobaXTerm, and Hue.
        I struggled a lot in the beginning as there were many challenging concepts that I could not understand. 
        I am a visual learner that learns best from visualisations. 
        There were also many times that I had to learn something from scratch—like how to use MobaXTerm to ingest data into the data lake, or query correctly from Hue to get the results I wanted.
        Understanding the old logic from the Tier 2 CLO Dashboard was also difficult, as I struggled to understand the syntax, code, and subqueries formatting.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>However, I maintained a positive and proactive attitude, remaining open to feedback and criticism, which allowed me to stay curious and motivate myself to improve the dashboard for the CLO Department. ]
        My fellow interns and I had frequent cross-sharing sessions which allowed us to dive into concepts mentioned in meetings and help each other understand concepts/topics together. 
        My supervisor was also very helpful in my enquiries, and I learnt a lot from shadowing him.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>If given another opportunity, I would like to be given more projects to make my technical skills more proficient, knowing I will have a great and useful impact for users. 
    I would also like to try my hands on some DevOps tools like JIRA, Jenkins, and Infinity Ticket etc. 
    I think this would help me in project management and being more organized, allowing me to document my work/learning more efficiently as well.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>Currently, as an intern, I can only do work when I am assigned work to do. So something I try to do in my downtime/free time is to learn data concepts and topics, or do simple sanity checks on my completed assigned work. 
        I think that I can definitely improve my attention to detail on visualisations. I often miss out tiny details, leading to more work. Now, I have learnt to be more detailed-orientated as well, checking up on assigned work frequently and efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
    Looking ahead, I think I am very interested in developing technical and soft skills, knowing that I can contribute to projects that impact users. I plan to work on personal projects to pursue more certifications to continue developing my expertise as a data engineer/analyst.
