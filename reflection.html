    <p>This internship gave me firsthand exposure to how data and systems are managed in a real-world enterprise environment. 
    I learned about the end-to-end process of ingesting data into a Datalake, building dashboards that support decision-making, and understanding the DevOps framework that supports smooth deployment. 
    I also learned how different departments collaborate using tools like Confluence, JIRA, and Bitbucket to maintain transparency and consistency in workflows.</p>

    <p>I applied knowledge learnt from classrooms like data structures,pipelines and dashboard designing in contributing to my project,
    while gaining new insights into DevOps(project lifecycle) and how data works in a huge and structured enterprise like OCBC.</p>

    <p>I developed technical skills in tools such as SQL, Excel, Power BI, MobaXTerm and Hue and improved my ability to understand documentation and ticketing systems. 
        Soft skills like communication, attention to detail, and task ownership were also important. I maintained a positive and proactive learning attitude, remained open to feedback, and was eager to understand how my work fit into the bigger picture.
    </p>

    <p>My knowledge of basic data handling helped me engage meaningfully in the Datalake ingestion process and understand the importance of PII handling and secure data transfers. 
        My communication and willingness to ask questions helped me clarify dashboard requirements with colleagues and understand JIRA structures, even if I wasn’t directly involved in DevOps tasks. 
        Thus making it easier for me to connect the dots between technical tasks and business outcomes.</p>

    <p>
        Professionally, I’ve become more confident in understanding technical documentation, explaining my work, and working in structured environments. It has helped me develop an understanding of corporate standards, workflows, and the importance of accountability and documentation. I now see how data plays a crucial role in decision-making and how even small tasks contribute to a larger organizational goal
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the main challenges was understanding technical processes and tools that I had not used before, like MobaXTerm, Hue etc.
        Initially, the amount of detail felt overwhelming. I overcame this by asking teammates for clarification, reading shared documentation on Confluence, and taking notes during meetings. 
        This allowed me to quickly understand and move on with my tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
        If given another opportunity, I would try to be more hands-on with tools like Jenkins or Bitbucket, even if only through mock tasks or shadowing sessions. 
        I would also try to document my own learnings in a clearer, more structured format to speed up my understanding. I would also like to be assigned more projects from different departments etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, I want to deepen my technical skills in data engineering and dashboard development, while also learning more about DevOps and automation tools. 
        This internship has shown me how valuable these skills are in large organizations, and I plan to build projects and take certifications to continue growing in this direction.
