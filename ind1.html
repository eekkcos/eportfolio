  <h3>Task 1: Datalake Ingestion for OCBCSG (Operations Department)</h3>
  <p>I was assigned the CLO (Consumer Loans Operation) Tier 3 Dashboard, which helps fellow OCBC colleagues in the CLO department to track their cases and KPI easily, improving their productivity and efficiency.</p>
  <p>As part of the data ingestion process we began by gathering user requirements through stakeholder meetings. 
     This helped us identify the essential columns needed and clarified which fields contained PII (Personally Identifiable Information). 
     After receiving the sample data, we anonymized all PII using hashing techniques and converted the files to .txt format before ingestion.</p>

  <p>The ingestion pipeline followed a structured process: load to landing, push to staging, then ingest into the source datalake (SRCDL) via MobaXTerm. 
    This phase was unexpectedly time-consuming due to unfamiliarity with MobaXTerm’s environment and command structure. 
    Setting up sessions, managing credentials, and navigating the correct file paths posed significant challenges.</p>

  <p>We encountered permission-related issues when placing files into landing, often due to ownership settings. We resolved these by learning and applying vim and basic Linux permission commands. 
    Additionally, we manually removed headers before ingestion to meet staging format requirements.In staging, we faced frequent errors related to data partitioning. 
    If audit files weren't deleted from the correct paths in HUE, the ingestion failed. 
    I also learned the importance of running MSCK REPAIR TABLE to sync Hive table metadata with actual partitions.
    In hindsight, automating the ingestion workflow with bash scripts or incorporating metadata checks earlier could have reduced manual effort and errors.</p>
    This task deepened my understanding of HDFS, HUE, Hive, and the importance of process validation in data engineering. It also improved my troubleshooting and teamwork skills through close collaboration with interns and supervisors.</p>
